A simple, base customer support chatbot aimed to be integrated into company websites and apps for user communication. Built with Next.JS, React, Tailwind CSS, and the Google Gemini API. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

The project is hosted on Vercel and can be viewed here: https://ai-customer-support-teal.vercel.app
